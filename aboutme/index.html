    <h2>BRIGHT OWUSU</h2>
    <p>My name is Bright Owusu, and some people call me "Bright." I'm currently pursuing a degree in software development. I'm passionate about swimming, and it's one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
    <p>I'm not married, and I don't have children or grandchildren. Right now, I'm focused on my education and building a foundation for my future career.</p>
    <p>What I love most about BYU-Idaho is how it makes education more accessible and helps people become better through learning. I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree (BS) at BYU-Idaho</p>
    <p>It could open up opportunities for freelance work, or I might integrate web design skills into my software development career.</p>
    <p>I decided to learn about careers in web design because I believe it's a valuable skill in today's digital age. I hope to gain practical knowledge that I can use both personally and professionally</p>
    <p>I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 6 years. While I don't have a specific favorite quote from a church leader, I find inspiration in many of their teachings.</p>
    <p>Thank you for looking at my web page</p>
